<h2>Car Insurance Web App Project</h2>
This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued. All insuree information is saved to a local database using the Entity Framework in Visual Studio.
