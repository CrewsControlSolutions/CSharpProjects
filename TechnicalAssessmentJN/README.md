<h1>Bracket Checker</h1>

<p>This simple console application checks for whether a string of text contains only matching bracket pairs. It is divided into two sections.</p>

<h2>Sections:</h2>
<ul>
  <li><h4>Bracket Pair Checking Method</h4></li>
  <li><h4>Unit Testing</h4></li>
</ul>
 
 <h4>Bracket Pair Checking Method</h4>
 <p>
  This method receives a string and returns a boolean. The logic is as follows. If the string contains only matching bracket pairs (e.g. "{}", "{abc...xyz}", or "{ {}{} }"), then the method returns true. The method also returns true in the edge case where the passed string contains no content (i.e. ""). If neither of these conditions are met, the method returns false.
 </p>
 
 <h4>Unit Testing</h4>
 <p>
  Unit testing consists of passing eight (8) different types of strings to the method.
