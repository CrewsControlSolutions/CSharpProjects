<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
<p>
This project is an MVC web app that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued. All insuree information is saved to a local database using the Entity Framework in Visual Studio.

 <h3>Black Jack Card Game</h3>
 <p>
 The classic game of Black Jack, where a player competes against the dealer (not multi-player) through a Console Application. There are multiple classes involved such as Player, Dealer, Card, Deck, and BlackJackRules, to name a few. This project served as practice for knowing when to build classes, how to build them, and when to inherit properties from other classes. It also served as an opportunity to build constructors and instantiate objects. Lastly, there is exception handling in the event that a player attempts to defraud the casino. For instance, if a player attempts to bet a negative amount of dollars, then the game immediately stops and a fraud attempt is logged.
